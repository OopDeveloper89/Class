Class
=====

A javascript library lets you create more readable classes.
The library has no dependencies. Just include it and have fun!

A quick example:

    // In your Person.js you could write something like this:
    Class.define('Person', {
        age : 35
     });
    
    // In another *.js file you could create a new instance of 
    // Person like this:
    var person = Class.create('Person');

And now have a lot of fun with class.js. :-)
